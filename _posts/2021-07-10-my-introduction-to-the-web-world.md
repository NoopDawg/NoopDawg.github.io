## Why am I making a website??

- I want to be more visible to the world
- I want to have a centralized location for where my ideas can live **and also be updated**
- Because then I can learn more about HTML and CSS (eventually Javascript)
- I want to get good at design and a personal website is like a display of your taste, style and brand
- My past year has been focused on cultivating my garden of knowledge in the note-taking, network thought application Roam Research. I've dumped my thoughts into this application and, within just one year, feel like I have a firmer grasp of what I've accomplished, the projects I'm working on, my future goals, what systems for productivity I'm using or have used in the past. 
- This website is an effort to bring the outside world a bit closer to the world in my brain.
- The world doesn't get access to my Roam database, (honestly it's not that interesting â€“ it's mostly scattered half-thoughts and abandoned productivity systems) but they get access to the website, which should force me to distill my thoughts into posts - defined as something I'd be proud to put out.... or at least okay with it.
